# examples/

Small programs built on the engine, one folder each. `examples/CMakeLists.txt` lists them, and
`scripts/new-game.sh` appends new ones there.

| Folder | Target | What it shows |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| `headless_smoke/` | `headless_smoke` | An `mge::Application` with **no modules**: no window, no GPU, SDL never initialised. It runs 1000 frames, generating a sandbox chunk per frame and checking terrain invariants, and exits non‑zero on failure (`setExitCode`). CTest: `smoke: headless_smoke headless 1000 frames`, also run under ASan/UBSan in CI |

New game or tool: `scripts/new-game.sh <name> [--headless]` creates `examples/<name>/` from
[`templates/`](../templates/README.md). Every program is declared with `mge_add_game()` (see
`docs/BUILDING.md`, "Adding a game"). Examples are built when `MGE_BUILD_MODULES=ON`.
